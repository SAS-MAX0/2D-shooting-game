# 2d Themed Shooter Game

This small 2d game allows you to control a player depending on the theme you chode and you fight against enemies.

## Features
- You can move the characters through WASD or the Arrow keys.
- Use space bars to shoot at the enemies.
- The game has themes that represent the way the player and the enemies look in different ways.
- Take note the enemies get smarter over time so the game can get difficult.
- When all the health is over the player dies then, you can use R to restart or H to go back to the main menu.
- Made use of HTML, JS (Vanilla) and CSS.

- I got some assets from both [Leonardo.ai](leonardo.ai), [Vapxiel](https://vapxiel.itch.io/gradient-circular-buttons/download/eyJleHBpcmVzIjoxNzM1MDQyNjY4LCJpZCI6NTcxODEyfQ%3d%3d.4ens7w2KKpjT1l%2fUFm%2fEV9LoFRc%3d) and [Freepik](https://www.freepik.com/free-vector/elegant-white-background-with-shiny-lines_4077186.htm#fromView=keyword&page=1&position=4&uuid=c84f69ba-329f-4b64-8428-dc0a848dd7a5")
- I also made use of AI in making the enemies become smarter overtime, making the images circular regardless of their size and to make the game better overall without being  overly dependant on it.
